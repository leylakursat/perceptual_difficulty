"English",32,36,"Yes",3,"Female",1,"It was kind of interesting that all of the objects I was shown were typical objects for the word given. Now, if they had asked how typical it was for that particular color or material to be used, than the answers might have been different. For example- the green boot. Is it a typical boot? Absolutely. Do I normally expect it to be green? Not really. But the question asked was if it was a typical boot. So I said highly yes. Maybe some distinction in the instructions would have been helpful?","list3"
